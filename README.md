4 players game in a shared local space in Unity

A mixed reality game made in unity with oculus integration kit where up to four players use hand tracking to throw magic orbs at moving targets in a shared local space.

Number of targets can vary from game to game as well as difficulty.
On easy mode, players have a water and a fire orbs. Throw an orb on a target to claim it with your color. You can reclaim targets by throwing a water orb on a fire target or a fire orb on a water target.
On hard mode, a third element is added; ice. For a rock/paper/scizor kind of game.

Game played on a local dedicated server which can show a view of what's going on a screen so that spectators can follow the game without headsets.

Made for an education and job fair to promote careers in IT. The game ran for three days with players going in and out with various level of experience with vr. The visual were made to match the booth's theme.

You can find in this repo only the scripts for the game since the assets are too large. I've included a couple of photos since it might be hard to picture, professionnal video from the event coming soon.
